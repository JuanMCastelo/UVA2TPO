# Mi Cursada 2025

This repository contains a small static website used to keep track of a 2025 academic schedule. It is built with plain HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. Bootstrap is loaded from a CDN so an internet connection is required when viewing the pages.

## Viewing locally

No build step is needed. Simply open `index.html` (or any of the HTML files) in your browser. You may also serve the directory with a small web server to avoid browser security restrictions:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

## Browser compatibility

The pages rely on standard HTML5, CSS and a bit of ES6 JavaScript. They work in all modern browsers such as recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. Internet Explorer is not supported.

## Deployment

Because the site is entirely static, you can deploy it by copying the files to any web server or by using a static hosting service like GitHub Pages.
